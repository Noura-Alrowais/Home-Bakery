## Tools & Technologies Used üîß

- **SwiftUI**: All user interfaces were built using **SwiftUI**, Apple's declarative framework for creating beautiful and interactive UIs for iOS applications.

- **MapKit**: Integrated to provide a seamless experience for users to view the course locations directly on the map. This ensures that finding the location for a baking class is easier than ever.

- **URLSession**: Used for networking to communicate with the backend API for fetching course data, booking information, and user authentication.

## API Integration üåê

The app relies on a simple but powerful **REST API** for course information, bookings, and user authentication. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôve integrated the API:

1. **Login Authentication**  
   - The user‚Äôs email and password are sent to the backend API for validation.
   - Upon successful login, the user‚Äôs profile and available courses are retrieved using a secure **GET** request.
   
2. **Fetching Courses**  
   - The app sends a **GET** request to the API to fetch available courses based on the user‚Äôs search.
   - The response contains details like **Course Info**, **Date & Time**, and **Location**, which are displayed to the user.

3. **Course Booking**  
   - When the user books a class, a **POST** request is made to the API to reserve their spot with the chosen course.
   - The API confirms the booking and updates the user‚Äôs profile with the course they‚Äôve enrolled in.

4. **Cancel Booking**  
   - A **DELETE** request to the API is made to cancel the user's booking if they no longer wish to attend the class.
   
5. **MapKit Integration**  
   - The location of each course is retrieved from the API and displayed on a **MapKit** map, making navigation to the location easier for users.
